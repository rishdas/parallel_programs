Q1) What common parallelism bug does this code appear to exhibit?

A:
The common parallelism bug which appears is no synhcronized access to shared
variables i.e no mutual exclusion. The code shared by all the threads are
worker_fun. Which in turn has access to shared/global variables.
/*
size_t num_threads, data_size;

volatile size_t round_num;

vector<uint32_t> data;
*/

Out these global variables data_size is read only and num_threads is not accessed.
Vector data and variable round_num is accessed in read and write mode. These
variables are accessed without synchronization between threads which gives
possiblilty for race condition.


2. Enter into the build/debug build directory and compile the executables.
Run the program pa1-dummy several times.

Q2) Describe at least two different observed behaviors from the program.
Does the bug identified in Question 1 explain the observed behavior?
Explain your answer.
